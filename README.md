<h3>Basic to Intermediate projects</h3>
<hr>
<p>These are some of the projects that helped me to become a better developer in the past few years so i decided to create a full repository full of many projects i did over the
years and how the helped me get aquainted with many programming paradigms!. I will highly appreciate if any contributors update this repo with their own projects and lovely
ideas the did inorder to become top developers

Thanks....</p>
